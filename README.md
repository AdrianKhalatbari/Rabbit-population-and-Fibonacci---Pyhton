Modelling growth: Rabbit population and Fibonacci
The second task is to model out the growth of the rabbit population in the optimal circumstances. In 1202, Fibonacci proposed the following puzzle, which we paraphrase here:
A man put a male-female pair of newly born rabbits in a field. Rabbits take a month to mature before mating. One month after mating, females give birth to one male-female pair and then mate again. No rabbits die. How many rabbit pairs are there after one year?
Your task is to create a program that can find out how many pairs of rabbits will be on the after 𝑁 months. The reproduction of rabbits in such an ideal world follows the Fibonacci defined by:
𝐹𝑛+1 = 𝐹𝑛 + 𝐹𝑛−1.
The initial conditions are 𝐹0 = 𝐹1 = 1. The sequence generated by this formula is:
𝐹2 = 2, 𝐹3 = 3, 𝐹4 = 5, 𝐹5 = 8, 𝐹6 = 13, 𝐹7 = 21, ...
This task is a typical example of simulating the real world using an algorithm. The simulation starts from a simple mathematical model, which is supposed to work in an ideal situation. Often the model can be far from the reality and several new factors must be considered in the model before it is really close to reality. In this course, we only try programming a simple mathematical model.
